# CASICAD

A hobby project to implement and visualize concepts from *Curves and Surfaces for CAGD* by Gerald Farin.  
The goal is not tied to a specific application — it’s driven by pure joy of exploring geometry, CAD, and math in practice.  
If it helps others along the way, even better!

## ✨ What’s inside
- Practical implementations of classic curve and surface algorithms  
- Visualizations with Python and Matplotlib  
- Step-by-step experiments with Bernstein polynomials, Bézier curves, and more  

---

## 🚀 Motivation
This repo is my personal playground for learning and experimenting.  
I want to take the beautiful theory from Farin’s book and make it *hands-on* with code.
