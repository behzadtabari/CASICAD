# CASICAD

A hobby project to implement and visualize concepts from *Curves and Surfaces for CAGD* by Gerald Farin.  
The goal is not tied to a specific application ‚Äî it‚Äôs driven by pure joy of exploring geometry, CAD, and math in practice.  
If it helps others along the way, even better!

---

## What‚Äôs inside
- Practical implementations of classic curve and surface algorithms  
- Visualizations with Python and Matplotlib and OCC
- Step-by-step experiments with Bernstein polynomials, B√©zier curves, NURBS and more  
- It is still under development!

---

## Motivation
This repo is my personal playground for learning and experimenting.  
I want to take the beautiful theory from Farin‚Äôs book and make it *hands-on* with code.
